# Exploring the Relationship Between Food Program Density and Crime Density: An Analysis of Vancouver Neighbourhoods
At a time when Vancouver is experiencing issues in food security, it is important to understand the effects
of food programs on the community. Our research project will explore the relationship between the
presence of free and low-cost food programs and crime rates. Specifically, we will be answering the
research question: **Do low-income communities with free and low-cost food programs have less crime
than other low-income communities? The findings from this research could assist policymakers in
deciding whether to invest more into these free or low-cost food programs to control crime rates.**

This paper was completed by Sidharth Mirchandani, Anishka Fernandopulle, Radhika Iyer, and Hajra Ojha as part of the requirements for ECON 326 in the Bachelor of Arts in Economics program at the Vancouver School of Economics, a faculty within the University of British Columbia.
