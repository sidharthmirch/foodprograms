# ECON xxx Research Project
At a time when Vancouver is experiencing issues in food security, it is important to understand the effects
of food programs on the community. Our research project will explore the relationship between the
presence of free and low-cost food programs and crime rates. Specifically, we will be answering the
research question: **Do low-income communities with free and low-cost food programs have less crime
than other low-income communities? The findings from this research could assist policymakers in
deciding whether to invest more into these free or low-cost food programs to control crime rates.**
